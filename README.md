# TA-Homework-Grader
A python script to download my students' programming projects from their gmail submissions, compile them, and check the results. This program leverages Python's imaplib library in order to log into my TA email account, search for a specific project in the subject headers of my recent emails, and download all attachments to the folder of my choosing for emails that satisfy the query. After extracting the source code of all the files it run the java or c++ code and generates clean output files with either the program output and submission information, or a relevant error message such as "Did not compile" or "Infinite Loop".
