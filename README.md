# TA-Homework-Grader
A python script to download my students' programming projects from their gmail submissions, compile them, and check the results. This program leverages Python's imaplib library in order to log into my TA email account, search for a specific project in the subject headers of my recent emails, and download all attachments to the folder of my choosing for emails that satisfy the query. 
Based on these samples: https://medium.com/@sdoshi579/to-read-emails-and-download-attachments-in-python-6d7d6b60269

# Features under Development:
Currently developing algorithms to run the java or c++ code and then grade the submission by comparing the program output to my user provided, correct sample.
